Added a new ambient sound effect for lightning
Added a new basic particle effect to the ghost prefab to give them particles they emit

Working on adding a linear interpolation light element to hopefully simulate lightning
Working on adding a dot product element for enemies to determine if character is close to do something(maybe another sound effect)
