Team: Kyle Hoekstra

Added a new ambient sound effect for lightning
Added a new basic particle effect to the ghost prefab to give them particles they emit

Added a linear interpolation light element to simulate lightning albeit a bit crudely

Working on adding a dot product element for enemies to determine if character is close to do something(maybe another sound effect)
